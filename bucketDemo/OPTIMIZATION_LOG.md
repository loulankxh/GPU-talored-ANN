# bucket2 pipeline — optimization log

Pipeline: `bucket2` (bucketing → bucket order → bucket-pair per-vector KNN, degree 64)
→ prune + reverse edges to degree 32 (`optimize` resident / `prune_windowed` + `optimize_chunked -m E`)
→ `translate_ids` back to original order.

Environment: cuVS / raft / rmm **26.10** (conda `cuvs-bench`), gcc 14 (conda `cuvs-build`),
Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB, **GPU 0 only**. Reference source for ideas: cuVS 26.12 (`/home/lanlu/cuvs`).
Driver: `/optimize-bucket2` skill (`.claude/skills/optimize-bucket2/`), judged by `scripts/judge.py`.

Measured per iteration:
- **build time**: wall clock of every stage (process start, all I/O included), summed.
  SIFT1M-auto = median of 3, SIFT1M-large and SIFT10M-large = 1 run.
- **(a) pre-prune index quality**: bucket2's degree-64 `vector_knn` vs the exact KNN graph
  (recall@k on 10K sampled base points).
- **(b) final search quality**: the final degree-32 graph (original ids) searched with cuVS
  CAGRA search (same searcher as for CAGRA's own graph), recall@10 + QPS at itopk 32…512,
  10K queries. SIFT1M is the quality gate; SIFT10M is reported when it runs.

CAGRA reference (cuVS 26.10, NN-Descent, intermediate degree 64 → graph degree 32):

| dataset | build (s) | recall@10 itopk 32 / 64 / 128 / 256 / 512 |
|---|---|---|
| SIFT1M | 11.54 (median of 3) | 0.9305 / 0.9782 / 0.9948 / 0.9988 / 0.9998 |
| SIFT10M | 122.59 (1 run) | — |

_(filled by iteration 0 — baseline)_

## Ideas backlog

- Skip the `neighbors.npy` conversion inside bucket2's "Write" step (the pipeline never reads it) or make it optional.
- SIFT10M Step 2 (centroid selection on the full 10M working set) is far slower than on 1M — sample before kmeans|| (cuVS kmeans uses a sampled init); compare `cpp/src/cluster/detail/kmeans_balanced.cuh` / `kmeans.cuh` init.
- Step 4.5 inline reorder and Step 6 `pool_build` / `scatter_pending` dominate the SIFT10M out-of-core loop — overlap host gather with GPU work (pinned staging, double buffering).
- Large path quality gap (prune_windowed vs cuVS optimize): SIFT1M recall@10 at itopk 32 is ~3 points below CAGRA — study `cpp/src/neighbors/detail/cagra/graph_core.cuh` (`optimize`: detour counting / rank-based pruning / reverse-edge merge) and align `prune_windowed_core.hpp` + `optimize_chunked` method E with it.
- `optimize` (resident) spends most of its time in file load + sanitize, not in the cuVS call.
